    Minimalistic view controller which just adds `AEImageScrollView` 
    to its view hierarchy, and has `image` property to set its content.
    It will also center content offset on the first call of `viewDidLayoutSubviews`.
 
    It may be used as is from code or storyboard, 
    but it's meant to be subclassed for custom funcionality, handling gyro motion data etc.
